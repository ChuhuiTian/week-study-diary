    "text": "6.2 Applications\nIn the third week of the course, the methods studied are widely applicable in the fields of environmental monitoring and urban planning. To illustrate this, one of the applications of radiometric calibration is the accommodation of the reflectance values in the satellite images to the surface materials. This becomes essential in case of detection of a subtle change in terms of the land cover or vegetation with the use of different time periods or sensors in the satellite images (Jensen, 2015). Compared to other correction methods, atmospheric correction is more specific because it enables the removal of distortions induced by particles and moisture in the atmosphere, a prerequisite for precision agriculture and water resource management.\nIn addition to that, the geometric rectification satellite images must be aligned well, which only can be done if there is a geographic map showing the ground coordinates. In order to achieve accuracy of in the process of land cover classification and change detection, these preprocessing steps have been successfully integrated in various studies. Through this week, not only the quality of remote sensing data improved but also contributed to decision processes in some areas like disaster responses and urban development.\nReflection\nAmong the many aspects that stood out to me in Week 3, I hold the notion that input data inevitably carries the quality of output data. Having acquired for myself the proficiency in image processing and correction methods through hands-on experiments, I was given the opportunity to understand the subtleties of preparing satellite images for a more advanced analysis. Consequently, I have come to perceive the fact that even the tiniest calibration defaults and corrections of the data may eventually affect the subsequent analytical results in a significant way. The later conviction encourages me to be more detailed in my mission in the future. The week has undoubtedly contributed to my realization that I am able to confidently work with the raw satellite data and I am very much inclined to employ my upgraded abilities for the resolution of more intricate analytical tasks within a short period.",

I learned to prepare and process satellite images specifically for land cover classification, beginning with loading vector data (FAO GAUL) to define the study area clearly—Shenzhen, in this case. I practiced data pre-processing, including cropping imagery to the region of interest and dealing with cloud coverage, which significantly affects data accuracy. Two distinct approaches to cloud masking were explored: filtering entire collections by low cloud cover percentages and applying pixel-based quality assurance masks.\nFurther, the practical work involved creating and managing training data for supervised classification models, particularly random forests. Through splitting datasets into training and test subsets, I could evaluate the classification accuracy, emphasizing the practical importance of methodological rigor in remote sensing projects. This reinforced the necessity of meticulous data handling to ensure accurate thematic mapping, crucial for applications in urban planning, environmental management, and disaster response.",

The Sentinel-2 satellite data, due to its accessibility and high spatial resolution, is extensively used in recent literature to study urban sprawl, land use change, and vegetation dynamics. For instance, Pal and Mather (2005) demonstrate the robustness of support vector machines in classifying remote sensing data, which provided context for understanding the comparative efficiency of random forests discussed in class.\nAdditionally, Jensen (2015) outlines the broader context of supervised and unsupervised classification methods, illustrating their practical applications in thematic map accuracy assessments. Recent advancements, highlighted in cloud-based remote sensing platforms like GEE (as discussed in the literature from GISGeography and Barsi et al.), underscore the transformative impact of cloud computing on image classification efficiency and scalability. This combination of theoretical understanding and practical application demonstrates the importance of selecting appropriate methods and data quality checks, especially cloud management, to achieve reliable classification results.",

This week, Quarto was the platform used for making a learning diary portfolio that was both interactive and reproducible. The lectures introduced the ideas of literate programming—a concept coined by Donald Knuth (1984)—which emphasizes the fluid dependence of code, narrative, and visualizations. I acquired the skills to initiate a Quarto project, understand its purposes using a _quarto.yml file, and most crucially structure the content into several chapters.\nDuring my time in the lab sessions, I learned how to use Markdown and insert YAML front matter to set metadata for my blog posts. I also played with inserting chunks of code, graphics, and interactive features into my documents. These approaches can be attributed to the tenets of reproducible research, which underscore the essentiality of careful recording and transparency in academic work (Allaire et al., 2019). Furthermore, the exercises included version control with Git, which allowed me to maintain order and facilitate my work through a sharing process—a very important skill set both for academic and professional levels.",

This practice will not only promote transparency of the research (Allaire et al., 2019) but also make collaboration more efficient through providing a linking space for updates and revisions.\nIn professional terms, the expertise acquired in Quarto is highly relevant to data science and technical documentation. A lot of companies may need thorough reports that are based both on the assessment conclusions and on clear visual communication. The functionality of multiple output formats (HTML, PDF, EPUB) allows flexibility in communications for changing audience groups. The adoption of version control tools such as Git will further reinforce the standard models of maintaining up-to-date and well documented abilities. These techniques (as per Wickham, 2014) allow technical reports to be sound, verifiable, and also easily comprehensible by stakeholders.",

This required manually specifying parameters, which may not be as precise as using a fully calibrated MTL file.\nLessons Learned: Always verify that the file paths and metadata requirements match the function expectations. When metadata is missing, a manual workaround is possible but requires careful validation.\nFuture Work Refinement: I plan to compare my custom correction results with those obtained using a full MTL file (if available) to refine the parameter settings.\nAdvanced Analysis: Further analysis, such as computing NDVI for vegetation monitoring and incorporating time-series data, will be explored.\nAutomation: Automating the process (e.g., integrating Earth Engine exports with local R processing via scripts) will be a goal for future improvements.\nConclusion This chapter has documented my workflow for processing Landsat 8 Surface Reflectance data without a standard MTL file, using a custom DOS correction method in R. The approach shows how to manually handle calibration parameters and adapt processing workflows when metadata is not available.

During the classes, we discussed the electromagnetic spectrum and how different sensors have the ability to detect data at various wavelengths. Through that lecture, conceptual clarity on terms like spatial, spectral, and temporal resolution, which are very important in understanding image quality and the process of data interpretation and analysis. For example, Lillesand et al. (2015) state that when choosing the characteristics of a sensor, there are different possibilities of information that can be obtained from an image.\nIn the other sessions, I got the chance to learn about satellite platforms like Landsat, Sentinel, and MODIS. The actual practice included basic image processing work, like enhancing some multispectral images and making some rudimentary radiometric corrections. This approach emphasized that data pre-processing is of great necessity, as it is a vital step in ensuring that what you have built your analysis on is very reliable (as emphasized by Jensen, 2015). In general, the tings that were covered within the week are of huge importance as they form the background knowledge necessary for practical and theoretical applications in the coming weeks.",

    "text": "4.2 Application\nBoth the theoretical and practical skills learned during Week 1 have important uses that cut across many fields. In environmental monitoring, the help of remote sensing is invaluable, as it assists in the tracing of deforestation, the monitoring of water quality, and the study of land cover. Landsat images, among others, have been used in the quantification of forest degradation over time, which consequently boosts reforestation policies (Wulder et al., 2012). In addition, the capabilities of processing satellite data open the doors to determining the health of various ecosystems, which is very helpful for the long-term management of natural resources. Through these applications, it is clear that remote sensing information is crucial for formulating the right environmental assessments and policies.\nIn an urban setting, the concepts learned are equally important. The availability of high-resolution satellite images has planners map sprawl in urban settings and track infrastructure development. Research has shown the combination of multispectral images with GIS leads to increases in classification accuracy in urban land use mapping (Pal & Mather, 2005). The combination of remote sensing and urban planning not only with information that leads to proper decisions but also plays an important role in building sustainable cities. From this literature, I consider having integrated these ideas into my learning, and thus I have come to understand that remote sensing practices have more cross-concentrating applications that call on the combination of technical and socioeconomic variables.",

Having earlier learned about image classification and preprocessing, I proceeded with my studies of the techniques for the detection of land-cover change and its quantification in time. I have become familiar with methods like post-classification comparison, direct image differencing, and thresholding, and I utilized these techniques in analyzing datasets acquired through the satellites like Landsat and Sentinel. Alongside this, I created NDVI time series and undertook k-fold cross-validation in order to check the stability of change detection models during our labs. The lectures also highlighted the fact that robust preprocessing, incorporating the processes of radiometric calibration, geometric rectification, and atmospheric correction, are vital for the reliable temporal analysis (Jensen, 2015; Lillesand, Kiefer, and Chipman, 2015). Such practical assignments taught me how slight alterations in vegetation from one season to the next, as well as changes in urban development over many years, are revealed through the study of satellite imagery. This week particularly highlights that integrating a number of different data sources and firm validation before interpreting results can help in improving the quality of change detection results.",

Change detection is a very important factor of environmental monitoring, as it allows us to track deforestation, see the variability of water resources, and study the effects of climate change on ecosystems (Richards, 2013; Foody, 2004). For example, by using NDVI time series data, scientists may ascribe vegetation health changes at a specified period of time, which could help monitor sustainable agriculture as well as wildlife management. Within the urban planning field, identification of the changes in land cover will help urban planners to observe the urban sprawl patterns and know where to build civic services as well as take actions to avoid disasters (Verbesselt et al., 2010). Furthermore, data from many sensors can be integrated so that the analysis will be as reliable as the view of the land cover will be comprehensive. Risk assessment in disaster management is supported via these new analysis methods by locating places of quick changes caused by natural hazards. All in all, the competencies acquired this week enable practitioners to deliver more precise, trustworthy, and applicable information for policy-making and scientific research.",

The experience with multi-temporal datasets was really beneficial, as it helped me improve my skills in preprocessing, change detection, and the validation of models for the future. The thing I learned is that the tiniest mistake in the calibration process and misalignment between pictures can result in huge inconsistencies in the outcome. This issue has been a reinforcement of the need for care in data handling and by using sound methods of evaluation. I feel that I am ready to experiment these approaches within the real environment for the purposes of wildlife conservation, city planning, and even crisis management. In the end, the study of temporal analysis in remote sensing during Week 8 not only established a deeper level of knowledge, but it also encouraged me to strive to master these methods in my upcoming tasks.",

Continuing from the previous weeks’ topics on supervised classification methods, I pursued the practical implementation of accuracy assessment, confusion matrix analysis, and cross-validation strategies, all to attain the highest accuracy possible in the classification tasks. During our classes, the relevant lecture emphasized a valid classification output by accuracy metrics, including overall accuracy, user’s accuracy, and producer’s accuracy, indispensable for quantifying approximation reliability (Jensen, 2015; Lillesand, Kiefer, and Chipman, 2015). In lab sessions, I tried out various classifier parameters and sample sizes to figure out the trade-offs between the complexity of the model and overfitting. Utilizing methods such as k-fold cross-validation allowed me to thoroughly quantify the applicability of my models. Through these practices, it became clear that the importance of a sound basis on which to evaluate remote sensing analyses goes beyond validation: it also sheds light on preprocessing of data and feature selection.",

Correctly estimating class accuracy is an example of that, which will help us in tracking the changes of land cover over time, helping to observe both deforestation and urban expansion (Pal and Mather, 2005). When it comes to environmental studies, radiometric and geometric corrections, with their reliability driven by intensive accuracy assessments, guarantee that remote sensing information will reflect on-ground conditions adequately, offering a sound support for trend analyses (Foody, 2004). Additionally, accurate classification will assist urban planners in making the deliberate choice of infrastructure and land-use planning, where even a small mistake can carry major economic and environmental consequences (Richards, 2013). Cross-validation is one of the advanced evaluation methods available that enables me to include various multi-source data for enhancing the overall performance of the analysis (Lu and Weng, 2007). Also, analytically coupling machine learning approaches with these techniques aids in automating the classification procedure for a wider range of contexts and datasets (Tso and Mather, 2009). By and large, comprehending the evaluation techniques provides a more valid basis for decision-making in academic research as well as in professional practice.",

This is where I have come to realize that perhaps the most correct interpretation of satellite data could still fall prey to a tiny defect in these accuracy assessments. The combination of theoretical knowledge with practical experience has given me the tools to accurately assess the model classification performance. This is an invaluable skill that will undoubtedly benefit my future projects. The learning curve in this week was notably steep, and I can say with confidence that these improved analytical skills will come in very handy in my future research projects.",

The mathematical models and empirical methods linking the sensors to atmospheric effects were presented in the lectures, where a focus was put on the sensor-oriented calibration. The results, corrected by the preprocessing, had to be compared from a reproducibility viewpoint. The enhancement methods I have implemented so far and have practiced with QGIS, which is one of the software programs for remote sensing.\nThese included histogram stretching and contrast adjustment, which were employed to improve the quality of the satellite images. Through these exercises, I gained a clear perception of how the preprocessing step turns the raw data into information that can be reliably used further for analyses.
