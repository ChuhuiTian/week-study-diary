# Slide 3: Sensor Specifications
  
Number of Bands: 11 bands covering visible, near-infrared, shortwave infrared, and thermal infrared

Spatial Resolution:
Panchromatic band: 15 meters
Multispectral bands: 30 meters
Data Types: Reflectance and thermal data
Coverage: Global, with data freely available

---

# Slide 4: Data Acquisition Methods

Data Acquisition Methods
Data are collected from solar reflection and land thermal radiation
A 16-day revisit cycle is maintained over the same area
Data are publicly released by USGS and NASA
Users can download data via platforms such as USGS Earth Explorer and Landsat Look Viewer

---

# Slide 5: Temporal Resolution

Spatial Resolution:
Panchromatic: 15 m
Multispectral: 30 m
Temporal Resolution:
16-day revisit cycle
Example Vegetation Indices:

NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index):
$$
NDVI = \frac{NIR - Red}{NIR + Red}
$$
Additionally, the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) is given by:
$$
EVI = 2.5 \times \frac{NIR - Red}{NIR + 6 \times Red - 7.5 \times Blue + 1}
$$
