# week 8 study diary
## Summary

In the 8th week of studying, I was concentrating on the advanced change detection and time series analysis as provided by remote sensing. Having earlier learned about image classification and preprocessing, I proceeded with my studies of the techniques for the detection of land-cover change and its quantification in time. I have become familiar with methods like post-classification comparison, direct image differencing, and thresholding, and I utilized these techniques in analyzing datasets acquired through the satellites like Landsat and Sentinel. Alongside this, I created NDVI time series and undertook k-fold cross-validation in order to check the stability of change detection models during our labs. The lectures also highlighted the fact that robust preprocessing, incorporating the processes of radiometric calibration, geometric rectification, and atmospheric correction, are vital for the reliable temporal analysis (Jensen, 2015; Lillesand, Kiefer, and Chipman, 2015). Such practical assignments taught me how slight alterations in vegetation from one season to the next, as well as changes in urban development over many years, are revealed through the study of satellite imagery. This week particularly highlights that integrating a number of different data sources and firm validation before interpreting results can help in improving the quality of change detection results.

## Applications

The methods and techniques that were practiced in week 8 have a huge number of applications, which are spread out in multiple fields. Change detection is a very important factor of environmental monitoring, as it allows us to track deforestation, see the variability of water resources, and study the effects of climate change on ecosystems (Richards, 2013; Foody, 2004). For example, by using NDVI time series data, scientists may ascribe vegetation health changes at a specified period of time, which could help monitor sustainable agriculture as well as wildlife management. Within the urban planning field, identification of the changes in land cover will help urban planners to observe the urban sprawl patterns and know where to build civic services as well as take actions to avoid disasters (Verbesselt et al., 2010). Furthermore, data from many sensors can be integrated so that the analysis will be as reliable as the view of the land cover will be comprehensive. Risk assessment in disaster management is supported via these new analysis methods by locating places of quick changes caused by natural hazards. All in all, the competencies acquired this week enable practitioners to deliver more precise, trustworthy, and applicable information for policy-making and scientific research.

## Reflection

After looking back at Week 8, I understand that it is difficult to overcome the issue of temporal changes, which brings along both hardships along with prospects for remote sensing. The experience with multi-temporal datasets was really beneficial, as it helped me improve my skills in preprocessing, change detection, and the validation of models for the future. The thing I learned is that the tiniest mistake in the calibration process and misalignment between pictures can result in huge inconsistencies in the outcome. This issue has been a reinforcement of the need for care in data handling and by using sound methods of evaluation. I feel that I am ready to experiment these approaches within the real environment for the purposes of wildlife conservation, city planning, and even crisis management. In the end, the study of temporal analysis in remote sensing during Week 8 not only established a deeper level of knowledge, but it also encouraged me to strive to master these methods in my upcoming tasks.
