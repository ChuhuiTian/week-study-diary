# Week 3 study diary

## Summary

By the end of Week 3, I was able to identify and apply image enhancement and preprocessing methods, besides the techniques explored in the remote sensing analysis. I was introduced to concepts such as radiometric calibration, atmospheric correction, and geometric rectification, which are of great value regarding the construction of the central core for my studies. The mathematical models and empirical methods linking the sensors to atmospheric effects were presented in the lectures, where a focus was put on the sensor-oriented calibration. The results, corrected by the preprocessing, had to be compared from a reproducibility viewpoint. The enhancement methods I have implemented so far and have practiced with QGIS, which is one of the software programs for remote sensing.

These included histogram stretching and contrast adjustment, which were employed to improve the quality of the satellite images. Through these exercises, I gained a clear perception of how the preprocessing step turns the raw data into information that can be reliably used further for analyses. This week served to confirm the idea that there is no compromise in the data preparation, a fact that is very critical for remote sensing workflow.

## Applications

In the third week of the course, the methods studied are widely applicable in the fields of environmental monitoring and urban planning. To illustrate this, one of the applications of radiometric calibration is the accommodation of the reflectance values in the satellite images to the surface materials. This becomes essential in case of detection of a subtle change in terms of the land cover or vegetation with the use of different time periods or sensors in the satellite images (Jensen, 2015). Compared to other correction methods, atmospheric correction is more specific because it enables the removal of distortions induced by particles and moisture in the atmosphere, a prerequisite for precision agriculture and water resource management.

In addition to that, the geometric rectification satellite images must be aligned well, which only can be done if there is a geographic map showing the ground coordinates. In order to achieve accuracy of in the process of land cover classification and change detection, these preprocessing steps have been successfully integrated in various studies. Through this week, not only the quality of remote sensing data improved but also contributed to decision processes in some areas like disaster responses and urban development.

Reflection

Among the many aspects that stood out to me in Week 3, I hold the notion that input data inevitably carries the quality of output data. Having acquired for myself the proficiency in image processing and correction methods through hands-on experiments, I was given the opportunity to understand the subtleties of preparing satellite images for a more advanced analysis. Consequently, I have come to perceive the fact that even the tiniest calibration defaults and corrections of the data may eventually affect the subsequent analytical results in a significant way. The later conviction encourages me to be more detailed in my mission in the future. The week has undoubtedly contributed to my realization that I am able to confidently work with the raw satellite data and I am very much inclined to employ my upgraded abilities for the resolution of more intricate analytical tasks within a short period.
